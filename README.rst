KdeConnectTray
==============

This program allows you to use Kde's "KdeConnect" features on any environment 
that supports System Tray Icons.
While KdeConnectTray is able to configure KdeConnect by itself, some plugins 
will still need Kde's SystemSettings.

Features
--------

- Device pairing, without the need of Kde's SystemSettings (which is still
  required for some plugins custom configuration).
- Device notifications management.
- Energy monitoring (battery status and charge/discharge extimation)
- Usage and notification statistics

Requirements
------------
-  Python 2.7
-  PyQt4 >= 4.11.1
-  KdeConnect >= 1.0.3

Usage
-----

Figure it out ;-)
Ok, let's get serious. I promise, I will add a small tutorial about this.
Keep in mind that this is an early release, and still needs a lot of work and 
fixes (and refactoring, I know).
For now it just works (or should) by running the ``kdeconnecttray.py`` script.
